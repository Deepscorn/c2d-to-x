Cocos2d obj-c to cocos2d c++ converter and some converted cocos2d learning materials

This project on github divides in two parts for now:

1. Cocos2d Cookbook Receipts, converted to cocos2d-x

2. c2d-to-x - tool for converting objective-c cocos2d to c++ cocos2d-x. During converting I wrote script, which can be useful for you - it converts most common constructions of objective-c cocos2d to C++ cocos2d-x. I call it alpha for now. It's a TCL script and it is cross-platform. Read the TCL file as text for more information.
